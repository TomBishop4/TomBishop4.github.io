            Hello! My name is Tom Bishop, and this blog was created for my ENGL 170 course.
            Here I will post written work, reflections, and assignments related to the class.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is a placeholder bio that I can revise and expand later to better reflect
            my interests, writing goals, and academic background.
